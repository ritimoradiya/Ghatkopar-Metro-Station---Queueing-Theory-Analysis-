# Ghatkopar-Metro-Station---Queueing-Theory-Analysis-
## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
- The project applies **queueing theory** to evaluate and optimize metro station operations.  
- The queuing system is analyzed using **M/M/4 (GD/âˆž/âˆž)** model.  
- It includes **real-time data collection**, statistical analysis, and **R-based distribution fitting**.  
- The study evaluates **service time, waiting time, queue length, and system efficiency** to identify bottlenecks and improve performance.
